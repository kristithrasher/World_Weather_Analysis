# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview 
Working on a project for PlanMyTrip internet top travel technology company.  
Jack is ahead of the analysis team and has asked me for help in addition to the user interface team. Jack as asked me to collect and present data for customers via search page so they can filter on preferred criteria when looking for vacation destinations.  This will help the customer find the ideal hotel anywhere in the world. We used many applications and software in our guide to complete this task.
All based on weather criteria as well so many different tools will be used.
We provided real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels and travel destinations based on weather search via input by customer. 
Destinations including dities and hotels were within a given range of latitude and longitude that provided the right kind of weather for the client.



## Tools used to complete job requirement 
Matplotlib to create scatterplot series. JSon weather data add to pandas dataframes
we will use linear regressions to perform statistical caluclations needed.  
We will export and clean data. 
All of this will help people find vacation spots based on weather criteria. 
Retrieve Data from API's
Store Data in DataFrames
Plot Data using matplotlib and google maps
Perform Statistical Analysis using SciPy

## Deliverable 1:  Retrieve Weather Data

## Summary
We completed this task by using API keys from goole. We used openweathermap and googlemaps. After retrieving the weather data. We then took the users input for desired weather temperatures asking them their desired min and max temperatures. Taking the users input we were able to retrieve hotel and city information and allow them to then choose their destination by once again the user entering the city's name they wanted to visit. Finalizing their requests with a travel itinerary map.
